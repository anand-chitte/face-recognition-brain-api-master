# SmartBrain
Final project for [The Complete Web Devloper in 2019 - Zero To Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/certificate/UC-3S6HBJWN/)

# Intro
> In this project, build a React web application called Jammming. I used my knowledge of React components, state, and requests with the Spotify API to build a website that allows users to search the Spotify library, create a custom playlist, then save it to their Spotify account.
